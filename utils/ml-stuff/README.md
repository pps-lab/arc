# Cryptographic Auditing MPC: Utils/ml-stuff

This folder houses the util scripts needed for the ml-example experiment.

The content is described as follows:

- `test1.py` & `test2.py` - The code describing the high-level code executed by the MP-SPDZ framework during the ml-experiment
- `ml-example.mpc` - This is the actual file that will be executed by the MP-SPDZ framework 
- `ml-example.sh` - This script is used by the `ml-example` experiment to execute the corresponding mpc file with MP-SPDZ. The scripts usage is exactly the same as with the `toy-example.sh` script.
