# Python Utils

This folder represents the package that contains all the python code that is part of the framework for executing the auditing_function
scripts together with MP-SPDZ and doe-suite.

## Usage

The package requires that the PYTHONPATH is set to contain the parent folder `utils`. The python code in this project expects this to be
the case.

For more documentation, please look into each Python Module.
